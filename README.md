# FDF, a wireframe model (School 42 project)
The FDF (Fil de Fer) project at 42 is a graphics programming task where you create a program in C to display a 3D wireframe map from a set of 2D coordinates.  
The input is a file containing a grid of elevation points, and the program visualizes the map using isometric projection.

**Key features of the project include:**
* Parsing the map file: Read and interpret a grid of elevation values from a text file.
* Rendering: Convert the 2D grid data into a 3D representation with lines connecting the points to form a mesh.
* Isometric projection: Display the 3D map in a 2D isometric perspective to provide depth and structure.
* Controls: Implement interactivity for zooming, rotating, and translating the view, allowing dynamic exploration of the map.
* Graphics library: Typically, the project uses the MiniLibX library to handle window management and drawing.
The project emphasizes skills in graphics programming, data manipulation, and mastering low-level rendering concepts.

## Known issues üö®
1. macOS not working out of the box (the project was written on Linux Ubuntu)
1. Lack of z-buffer ‚Äì resulting in line overlay problems (best seen on big maps like ./maps/t1.fdf)
1. Due to the limitation of the MLX library, the control panel text is output to the window, not the image.
This sometimes results in blinking (because of the constant rerendering).
However, it perfectly shows why we should use the image pre-render for the main part of the program.  
It's best to reimplement this functionality with an XPM image
